#Purpose of the repo

Not all of us have worked with GIT before, so to get us all off to a good start on the project, I created this test repo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
#Your task 

Please add your name to the document "name.txt" by first cloning the repo, then adding your name to the document, and then pushing the repo again.


If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (Jonas)! 

I can recommend the video to you if you have never worked with it before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk
